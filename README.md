CS 2400 Project 5 - Graph Traversal

## i) Group Members : John Salinas(JohnSalinas123), Priscilla Ballesteros(PBallesteros02), Daniel Rodriguez(drodriguez97)

## ii) Member Contributions:

````
Set up project with given code (John Salinas, JohnSalinas123)
  => set up datastructures that will be used
  => set up utility methods for graph class
````

### Adjacency matrix version
````
Implement: Create the graph shown in Task 1 instructions (John Salinas, JohnSalinas123)
````

````
Implement: breadth-first traversal algorithm (Priscilla Ballesteros, PBallesteros02)
  => traversal begins at node labeled A
````

````
Implement: Create graph shown in Task 2 instructions (Name goes here)
````

````
Implement: Iterative algorithm that performs depth-first traveral of graph (Daniel Rodriguez, drodriguez97)
  => using a stack for your iterative algorithm (don't use recursive method)
````

### Adjacency list version

````
Implement ListGraph.java methods for the adjacency list representation (John Salinas, JohnSalinas123)
````


Screencast recording, talk about your code briefly, less than 3 minutes (All members)

Unit testing on added methods using unit test framework (John Salinas, JohnSalinas123)


## iii) Extra Features

### Made two versions, using adjacency matrix and adjacency list representation

### iv) How to run code

```` 
1. Make MatrixGraph or ListGraph, passing in the number of verteces
2. Set the labels of the verteces
3. Add the edges to each vertices
4. Make a LinkedQueue to hold result of getBreathFirstTraversal or getDepthFirstTraversal
5. Use printTraversalLabels_forList or printTraversalLabels_forMatrix to print the traversal order with the labels
